# BabyTracker



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Todo
1. Remove Month from Baby Tracker homepage after deleting all feeding in that month
2. When adding feeding, add it to the current Firestore document for that month if available
3. Get checkboxes working on Add-Feeding component
4. Add easier delete buttons (currently you dblclick on time)
5. Update functionality
6. Authentication/Login & Register pages
